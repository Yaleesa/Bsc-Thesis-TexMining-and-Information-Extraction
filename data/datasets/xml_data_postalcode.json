This trip can also suit someone in employment that has some holiday entitlement to use up - I can do trips in 2 weeks, basically I can go several times a year between April and October, whenever I have a suitable companion. My hobbies and Business are inseparable: Building work, cars, boats and I work with a range of tradespeople in Nottingham. I have two French houses and boats in Brittany and St Tropez. I am best known as designer and manufacturer of sports cars (Google \"Spartan Cars\")and I have 3 of my own as well as Porsche and Jaguar, France trips usually use big Nissan Patrol and a trailer loaded with building materials for the two house renovation projects plus mechanics tools as I cannot resist disappearing in the engine room on my boat (Google Trader 47). Luckily you have your own en suite cabin \"Boat is gorgeous\" said Lizzie who did two trips.<\/p>\n<p>The role includes shopping, cleaning, cooking and general maintenance duties. You will have free time to spend at the beach or around town. Travel is paid in full to include travel car journey down to France, in farmhouse, B and B's Flying home is an option on the arranged availability\/date. On the journey down we stay at my two house renovation projects and we will do some work there with general duties, before heading off to one of the boats.<\/p>\n<p>The Journeys end is near St Tropez where I rent a mobile home (Google \"Parc St James\" and\/or \"Direct Holiday Homes 5144B\" to see actual one we rented last year).

(retail price of approx &pound;5 means a low cost discretionary purchase for students during freshers week and the following few weeks).<\/p>\n<p>(please note these wall planners are specific to the term dates \/ exam dates etc for each univeristy - they are not generic - all designs will be shared with interested candidates).<\/p>\n<p>2) Sales strategy may include selling to retailers (eg convenience stores in student areas) and \/ or direct to students (eg: at freshers fairs etc).<\/p>\n<p>3) Preferably use and recruit contacts from other universities to gain insight across the Liverpool \/ Manchester \/ Sheffield \/ Leeds universities grouping - subcontracting or hiring of contacts at the other universities is not a problem. The right candidate will hopefully be able to build a sales group across some or all of the 4 cities to implement the optimal sales strategy.<\/p>\n<p>4) Advise on social media and other marketing channels that may assist to drive awareness and sales.
